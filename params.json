This technical construction consists of \r\nfirst creating the main unit fully optimized with DFT in the gas phase \r\nand getting the corresponding NBO or Mulliken charges. The next phase \r\nis to repeat this unit in all three directions with the same corresponding \r\ncharges of the main unit. Overall, this is the assumption where we have\r\nassumed that the system is homogenous, the electrostatic field is the same \r\neverywhere. Now, we have to fix the boundary points. This, however, is a \r\ndifficult problem because the truncated charges have to be taken into account. \r\nThis is explained in the thesis. \r\n\r\n![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7361722/71469992-1d33cd80-27cb-11ea-9a45-2b2552446ce3.png)\r\n\r\nThis complex construction was part of a PhD thesis in which we devise a method to construct Fe(bpy) based MOFs. It uses python libraries. The Amber FF parameters were fitted to DFT calculations.
